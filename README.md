# hello-world
First repository

Hi all,

Thanks Dataquest for directing me to GitHub! I'm finding Python to be interesting.  It's a bit different from the C variants not to mention the good old languages like LISP, Pascal, PL/1, Assembly, etc.  Studying Data Analysis/Science is proving to be more interesting then computer security (aka Cyber Security).  

Other interests? kids(diapers and diplomas... an interesting stage of life!), dogs(big ones), cats(well this one), tea(definitly not coffee)...
